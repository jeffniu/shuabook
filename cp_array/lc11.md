## 11. Container With Most Water

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.


###### Brute force approach 
for every pair of integers in the array, calculate the area and record the max in the process. Time complexity is O(N^2). Space complexity is O(1).

###### Two pointer techniques
1. use two pointer to mark left and right end of the array
1. always move in the shorter one inward until the two pointers meet.
1. record a max area during the process

```java

	public int maxArea(int[] nums) {
		if (nums == null || nums.length <= 1) return 0;
		int left = 0;
		int right = nums.length; // index out of bound
		int max = 0;
		while (left < right) {
			int area = Math.min(nums[left], nums[right]) * (right-left);
			max = Math.max(area, max);
			if (nums[left] <= nums[right]) {
				left++;
			} else {
				right--;
			}
		}
		return max;
	}
```

Above code failed on following test cases:
